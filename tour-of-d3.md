## What is D3?

[D3.js](http://d3js.org/) is a Javascript library.
D3 is for binding data to DOM elements.
It can be used for generating [basic charts](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Gallery#basic-charts).
It can be used for [animating things](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/1256572).
It can be used for generating quite advanced charts too (like [maps](http://bl.ocks.org/r4vi/4185745), [force-layouts](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/929623), and many other [weird chart types](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/uberdata/)).

As I explain things, I will often refer to Scott Murray's fantastic (and free!) online book, [found here](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000345/index.html).


## The Basics

D3 is many things, but also isn't many things.
- It can **load data** files in the browser so you can use it for your graphs/etc.
- It can **attach** elements to the browser's DOM based on that data.
- It can **transform** your data in many ways so it's ready to be used in a graph.
- It can **transition** your elements between states, and **animate** those elements.
- And, as a bonus, it can create a few **preset graph types** for you, although it is often used as a low-level tool to create your own types of graphs.

At Soso, we use it mainly for 2 things:
- to quickly **see the data**, get a sense of its shape, and understand what deeper meaning it may hold or what "stories" could emerge from it.
	- this often leads us to the creation of a _dashboard_ to see and browse the data, which is also a great tool for the client.
- to quickly **create a prototype** of a more complex app that want to eventually create.
	- the prototype could be a 1st phase in a large project for which the final product is a robust C++ app.

Once you're used to it, D3 really is great for taking a bunch of data and throwing it up on the page, to see what it looks like.


## A Fast Track Lesson

Here's a quick primer via a [small tutorial](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000002001/index.html) by Scott Murray. All the basics are there. If you want more, I recommend looking at the sections of his book.

For understanding the trickier parts, I will break it down, below.


## A More Detailed Explanation


### Attaching Elements to the Page

_WIP: usually SVG, data-join pattern._

With D3, you can attach HTML or SVG elements to the page. Usually, people use SVG elements, as they provide primitive shapes already (lines, circles, rectangles, etc) and are vector-based (meaning, they are always crisp, no matter if you scale them, and never pixelated).

The key to understanding how D3 attaches elements to the page, is to understand the 3 stages of [the data-join](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/join/) : enter, update, and exit.

### Transforming the Data

_WIP: talk about my most used functions. My must-have libraries (underscore, moment)._

Ok, first off, you have data (in a file, from a streaming endpoint, etc). It rarely is formatted exactly how you want it in order to create a graph with it. You need to transform it.

Let's say your data is an array of books. Sorting the data by publication date is a transformation. Or grouping the books by category is another transformation.

#### Libraries

D3 can be used for some sorts of transformations. But you'll often need other libraries to provide more transformation firepower. We typically use:

- [Underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org/) or [Lodash](https://lodash.com/) : for sorting, grouping, and all sort of object & array manipulations. I don't usually need Lodash but it has a few hardcore functions that Underscore lacks, like _.clone().
- [Moment.js](http://momentjs.com/) : for transforming data based on time (meaning dates).

#### Most Commonly Used Functions

- d3.max() and d3.min() : to get the min or max item in a collection.
- d3.extent() : to get bot the min & max items at once.
- d3.scale() and its many varieties : to map a value from one range to another.
- _.groupBy()
- _.sortBy()
- _.pluck()

_... TO BE CONTINUED_

I defer all explanations of how to transform data to http://learnjsdata.com/ since they cover everything (see below).

#### More Tips & Tricks

The guys at Bocoup wrote a great guide for parsing data in JS. Our parsing tactics are very very similar, so I recommend we use it as a guide for various ways to parse various things.

http://learnjsdata.com/

There are exceptions, however -- I prefer other tactics to theirs on occasion -- and they will be posted here. Feel free to do the same if you notice a better way to do things.

##### Exceptions:
- [Deep Cloning](http://learnjsdata.com/iterate_data.html):
	- for collection of objects with only basic property types (ints, strings, etc -- but not Date objs, and other complex types), that can also be nested (ie. "deep"), use:

	```javascript
	var deepPrimitiveCopy = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify( dataObject ));
	```

	- for collection with complex property types, that is not nested (ie. not "deep") use lodash:

	```javascript
	var shallowCopy = _.clone(dataObject);
	```

	- for collection with complex property types, that is nested (ie. "deep") use lodash:

	```javascript
	var deepCopy = _.clone(dataObject, true);
	// or
	var deepCopy = _.cloneDeep(dataObject);
	```

	- NB:
		- [Performance comparison](https://jsperf.com/lodash-copy-vs-json-stringify-parse)
		- [All-time quickest cloning method](http://stackoverflow.com/a/5344074/2543345) is to write your own custom cloner, if you know in advance what the structure of the data will be like.

- [Sorting](http://learnjsdata.com/iterate_data.html):
	- if you have an array of complex objects that you want to reverse the sorting on (ex: itâ€™s in ascending but you want descending) as they say d3.ascending/d3.descending won't work, but you can use the native JS Array.reverse() function:

	```javascript
	filteredPatentObjects.reverse();
	```

##### Benchmarking performance

If you need to evaluate the performance of your code, you can use the web developer console in Chrome.

If you need to pit two snippets of code against each other, to see which performs best, you can use https://jsperf.com/


### Transitioning & Animating the Data

_WIP_


## Graphs built into D3

D3 provides the following [layouts](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Layouts) that generate pre-made graphs for you, if you feed them the data correctly (each layout wants its data in different ways). See the [examples gallery](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Gallery) for ideas of what they can look like.


## Performance Limits

Using SVG in D3 becomes too heavy when you have more than 3000 data elements on the page.

Using Canvas with D3 can be more performant, depending on the scenario.

Using WebGL is the most performant, as it uses the graphics card, but that requires very different techniques that don't necessarily blend well with D3.

_... TO BE CONTINUED_


## Next Steps

_WIP_

### Increasing performance

_WIP: canvas, webgl, pixi.js_

### 3D possibilities

_WIP: webgl, pixi.js, three.js, openVizConf videos about that_

### Using D3 with other frameworks

_WIP: MVC (react.js, link openVizConfVideo, Swizec Teller book), multiple file loading and concurrency with Queue.js, etc._

### Potentially useful libraries

_WIP: MISO, NVD3, etc? see scott murray's book for more._
